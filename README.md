New boards can be made with new word sets in real-time, either by pasting in desired words, or by using a [PoetryDb](http://poetrydb.org/index.html) API call. Clients are synced between rooms using WebSockets.

Tutorial to come.

## TO-DO:
[  ] Write tutorial on Client+Server code & Heroku deployment steps

[  ] Write unit tests for client and server functionality

[  ] Add functionality to save word lists

[  ] Add Oulipo (N+7) mode to creatively mutate existing wordlists

[  ] Better collaboration features ("Forking") of existing boards

[  ] View-only mode for rooms that are at capacity for modification


## Time Goals:
